# LearnGL
A simple OpenGL app capable of playing custom-made, retro-inspired formats of data. Will be updated when new formats emerge.

Future plans include implementing controller support, and, eventually, transforming the project into a fully fledged PC port of a game.

Note: The formats may change as my skills improve, and I get access to better documentation. Using them in your projects may result in having to rewrite parts of your code.
Additionally, the algorithms in charge of encoding are mere placeholders. Proper ones will be included in Darkforge. In the meantime, feel free to implement your own.
